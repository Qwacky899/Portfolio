                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hey, I'm Harry, better known as "Qwacky89" online. I'm 16 years old and I've been obsessed with game development and 3D modeling since 2019. What started as just messing around in Roblox Studio and Blender quickly became a full-on passion. I'm always trying new ideas, learning new skills, and figuring out how to make cooler and more polished projects each time. Honestly, I jump between projects a lot (my brain doesn't like to sit still), but every single one teaches me something valuable that I bring into the next.</p>
                <p>For years I was just exploring, learning the ropes—building random systems, creating mechanics, experimenting with UI, and slowly getting better at design and polish. I went through burnout phases and a lot of unfinished ideas, but with each failure I learned how to plan better and work smarter. Recently though, everything clicked. My game "Timberfall" is my first fully built project that I actually want to release, and it's proof to myself that I've come a long way since the start.</p>

                <h2>Roblox Game Progress: Then vs Now</h2>
                <p>When I first started making Roblox games seriously, I jumped straight into creating a slime-eating game. It had some fun mechanics but I quickly ran into messy systems, burnout, and lots of bugs. Fast forward to today: my newest game Timberfall shows how much I’ve grown in planning, clean systems, and actually finishing a full game properly.</p>

                <h2>3D Modeling Progress: Then vs Now</h2>
                <p>This is probably my favorite part to look back on. My first sword model was super simple (basically a cylinder). Compare that to my more recent stylized fantasy sword — every bit of practice and every failed attempt over the last year added up to this.</p>

                <h2>UI/UX Progress: Then vs Now</h2>
                <p>UI was something I really struggled with early on. My first interfaces were very basic, clunky, and pretty ugly if I'm honest. Over time I got better at making fun, themed UI that matches the style of my games. Here's a side-by-side of my earlier basic UI and some of the more polished stuff I'm creating now.</p>

                <p>Here's a quick gameplay showcase of Timberfall in action. The systems are simple but polished, and seeing it fully functional has been super satisfying after years of learning and failing.</p>
