            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey, I'm Harry. I'm 16 years old and I've been obsessed with game development and 3D modeling since 2019. What started as just messing around in Roblox Studio and Blender quickly became a full-on passion. I'm always trying new ideas, learning new skills, and figuring out how to make cooler and more polished projects each time, I jump between projects a lot (too many new ideas), but every single one teaches me something valuable that I bring into the next.</p>
            <p>For years I was just exploring, learning the ropes—building random systems, creating mechanics, experimenting with UI, and slowly getting better at design and polish. I went through burnout phases and a lot of unfinished ideas, but with each failure I learned how to plan better and work smarter. Recently  though, everything clicked. My game "Timberfall" is my first fully built project that I actually want to release, and it's proof to myself that I've come a long way since the start.</p>
