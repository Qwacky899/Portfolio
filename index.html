                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hey, I'm Harry, better known as "Qwacky89" online. I'm 16 years old and I've been obsessed with game development and 3D modeling since 2019. What started as just messing around in Roblox Studio and Blender quickly became a full-on passion. I'm always trying new ideas, learning new skills, and figuring out how to make cooler and more polished projects each time. Honestly, I jump between projects a lot (my brain doesn't like to sit still), but every single one teaches me something valuable that I bring into the next.</p>
                <p>For years I was just exploring, learning the ropesâ€”building random systems, creating mechanics, experimenting with UI, and slowly getting better at design and polish. I went through burnout phases and a lot of unfinished ideas, but with each failure I learned how to plan better and work smarter. Recently though, everything clicked. My game "Timberfall" is my first fully built project that I actually want to release, and it's proof to myself that I've come a long way since the start.</p>

                <h2>My Progress: Then vs Now</h2>
                <p>Sometimes I look back at where I started and realize just how far I've come. On the left: one of my very first 3D models from last year (simple sword). On the right: my recent fully stylized sword project. Every model, every attempt, every bit of practice adds up.</p>

                <h2>Timberfall (2025)</h2>
                <p>Timberfall is my first fully developed and properly managed game. It's heavily inspired by old school Roblox hits like Lumber Tycoon 2, but built with everything I've learned over years of experimenting. For the first time, I sat down, properly planned systems, made flowcharts, blocked out features, and actually finished the thing! It's not huge or flashy, but it's functional, fun, and polished.</p>

                <h2>Squid Game Lobby</h2>
                <p>This was my attempt to create a Squid Game multiplayer lobby for a solo project. The focus was building a large-scale environment that still feels like part of the show, while experimenting with lighting, level composition, and atmosphere.</p>

                <h2>College Building Recreation</h2>
                <p>Blender project recreating the college I'm hoping to attend one day. Mainly focused on practicing accurate modeling, architectural detail, and lighting design. Really happy with how this one turned out as it taught me a lot about reference-based modeling.</p>

                <h2>Stylized Urban House</h2>
                <p>Saw a cool house on Pinterest and thought: "I wanna make that." This was a practice in hand-painted texturing and building a cozy, slightly stylized urban scene. Loved experimenting with lighting for the nighttime vibe.</p>
