            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey, I'm Harry. I'm 16 years old and I've been obsessed with game development and 3D modeling since 2019. What started as just messing around in Roblox Studio and Blender quickly became a full-on passion. I'm always trying new ideas, learning new skills, and figuring out how to make cooler and more polished projects each time, I jump between projects a lot (too many new ideas), but every single one teaches me something valuable that I bring into the next.</p>
            <p>For years I was just exploring, learning the ropesâ€”building random systems, creating mechanics, experimenting with UI, and slowly getting better at design and polish. I went through burnout phases and a lot of unfinished ideas, but with each failure I learned how to plan better and work smarter. Recently  though, everything clicked. My game "Timberfall" is my first fully built project that I actually want to release, and it's proof to myself that I've come a long way since the start.</p>

            <h2>Timberfall (2025)</h2>
            <img src="timberfall.png" alt="Timberfall">
            <p>Timberfall is my first fully developed and properly managed game. It's heavily inspired by old school Roblox hits like Lumber Tycoon 2, but built with everything I've learned over years of experimenting. For the first time, I sat down, properly planned systems, made flowcharts, blocked out features, and actually finished the thing! It's not huge or flashy, but it's functional, fun, and polished, and can be base-released very, very soon!</p>

            <img src="squidgame.png" alt="Squid Game Lobby">
            <p>This was my attempt to create a Squid Game multiplayer lobby for a solo project. Also tried experimenting with lighting, level composition, and atmosphere.</p>

            <p>Blender project recreating the college I hope to attend one day. Mainly focused on practising accurate modelling, architectural detail, and lighting design. Really happy with how this one turned out as it taught me a lot about reference-based modeling.</p>

            <p>Saw a cool house on Pinterest and thought: "I wanna make that." This was a practice in hand-painted texturing and building a cozy, slightly stylized urban scene. Loved experimenting with lighting for the nighttime vibe.</p>

            <p>Over the years I've experimented a ton with UI design inside my games, trying to make interfaces that fit the style and vibe of the games I'm building. Here's a few snapshots from my Squid Game prototype and my early slime eating game project.</p>
